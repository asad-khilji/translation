        <p>The Opening</p>
        <p>Revealed in Makkah</p>
        <p>With the name of Allah, the extremely loving & caring right now, the always loving & caring</p>
        <p>1. All praise and thanks is for Allah, Master of all nations and people.</p>
        <p>2. The extremely loving & caring right now, the always loving & caring.</p>
        <p>3. Master of the day of judgement.</p>
        <p>4. You alone do we willingly enslave ourselves to, and You alone do we desperately seek help from.</p>
        <p>5. Guide us along the straight path, which is upwards.</p>
        <p>6. The path of those whom You have favored.</p>
        <p>7. But not the path of those who have wrath upon themselves, nor those who are lost.</p>
        <p>Ameen</p>
