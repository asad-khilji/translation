        <p>The Cow</p>
        <p>Revealed in Madinah</p>
        <p>With the name of Allah, the extremely loving & caring right now, the always loving & caring</p>
        <p>1. Alif Laam Meem</p>
        <p>2. That is the book. There is absolutely no doubt about it. An amazing guidance is for the cautious.</p>
        <p>3. Who believe in the unseen, establish salah, and only in what We have provided them, they spend.</p>
        <p>4. And who believe in what was sent to you and what was sent much before you and have absolute conviction in the afterlife.</p>
        <p>5. Those people are committed to guidance from their Master, and those people are the reapers of success.</p>
        <p>6. Certainly those who disbelieve it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will never believe.</p>
        <p>7. Allah has placed a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and even over their eyes is a covering, and for them is a great punishment.</p>
        <p>8. And from among the people is someone who says "we have believed in Allah and even in the afterlife." No! They are not believers at all!</p>
        <p>9. They try to deceive Allah and those who believe but they do not deceive anyone except themselves. They have no realization at all!</p>
        <p>10. There is a disease in their hearts. Then Allah increased them in sickness. They have a constantly painful punishment because they habitually used to lie.</p>
        <p>11. And when it is said to them do not cause corruption in the area, they say “we are only peacemakers.”</p>
        <p>12. Listen up! It is they, THEY, who are the cause of corruption and they have no realization at all!</p>
        <p>13. And when it is said to them believe as the people have, they say “should we believe as the fools have.” Listen up! It is they, THEY, who are the fools and they have no knowledge of it.</p>
        <p>14. And when they are with the believers they say “we believe” but when they are alone with their devils they say “we are with you and we are only mocking them.”</p>
        <p>15. Allah throws their mockery back at them and allows them to continue in their transgression wandering blindly.</p>
        <p>16. Those are the ones who have purchased misguidance for guidance. Their trade did not produce any profit. They were never committed to guidance at all!</p>
        <p>17. Their example is something like the example of someone who tried to light a fire. Then when it illuminated everything that was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness so they could not see.</p>
        <p>18. Deaf! Mute! Blind! So they will not return.</p>
        <p>19. Or it is like a rainstorm from the sky in which there is heavy clouds, darkness, thunder, and lightening. They press their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps for fear of death, and Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers.</p>
        <p>20. The lightening almost snatches away their eyesight and when it lights the way for them they walk in its light but when darkness covers them they stand still. If Allah had willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight and Allah is over all things completely capable.</p>
        <p>21. People! Be enslaved to your Master who created you and those much before you so that you may hopefully protect yourselves.</p>
        <p>22. It is He who created the earth for you as a comfortable bed spread out and made the sky as a ceiling and sent down from the sky rain providing all kinds of fruits. So do not associate partners with Allah while you people know very well.</p>
        <p>23. And if you are in any doubt about what we have revealed to our slave then produce a surah like it and call upon all your witnesses other than Allah if what you say is true.</p>
        <p>24. But if you are not able to do so and you will never be able to do so then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones, which has been prepared for the disbelievers.</p>
        <p>25. And congratulate the believers who do a few good deeds asked of them. They will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit from it, they will say “we had this from before” it will be given to them in likeness, they will have purified spouses, and they will remain in it forever.</p>
        <p>26. Certainly Allah is not shy to present an example of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Master. The disbelievers say “what does Allah intend by using THIS as an example?” He misguides by it great many, and He guides by it great many and He misguides not except the defiantly disobedient.</p>
        <p>27. Who break the promise of Allah after it was made, separate that which Allah has ordered to be joined together, and cause corruption on the earth. It is they who are the ultimate losers.</p>
        <p>28. How can you disbelieve or be ungrateful to Allah when you used to be dead, then He brought you to life, then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life, then to Him you will all be returned.</p>
        <p>29. It is He who created the earth for you altogether then He rose above the throne and directed His attention towards the heavens, creating seven heavens one above the other, and He has knowledge of all things.</p>
        <p>30. And remember when Allah said to the angels “I am placing someone who is left behind to make his own decisions on the earth.” They said “are you placing in it one who will cause corruption and spill rivers of blood, while we declare your perfection and sanctify your praises.” Allah said “certainly I know that which you do not know.”</p>
        <p>31. And Allah taught Adam the names and descriptions of all things and He presented them to the angels saying “tell Me the names and descriptions of these if what you say is true.”</p>
        <p>32. They said “how perfect You are Allah! We have no knowledge except for that, which You have taught us. Certainly You, it is You who is truly All Knowing and All Wise.”</p>
        <p>33. Allah said Adam inform them of their names and descriptions then when Adam did so Allah said “did I not tell you that I know the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and I know what you reveal and what you conceal.”</p>
        <p>34. And because of the reason of Adam We told the angels to prostrate and they all prostrated except for Iblis who refused and became ungrateful.</p>
        <p>35. And We said Adam enter with your wife throughout the gardens and eat and drink from it care free but do not approach this tree or else you will be from among the wrong doers.</p>
        <p>36. But satan caused them to slip and they were removed from the condition in which they were in.  We said go down all of you as enemies to each other. You will have a place of settlement and provisions for your appointed stay on earth.</p>
